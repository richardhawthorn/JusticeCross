justicecross
============

A friend of mine is really into the band Justice, who, when on stage, have a massive glowing cross behind them (cross being the name of their first album). I decided to build him a cross for his birthday, it wouldnâ€™t be quite as big, but it would be just as bright.

This code was written to control the leds of the cross, and designed to be used with 2 x TLC5940 pwm chips

The code relies on the following library, and was written for Arduino 023
